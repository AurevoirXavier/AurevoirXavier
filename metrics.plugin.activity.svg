This PR is the second part of the pure state sync refactoring,
encapsulating `StateSyncMetadata` as a separate entity. Now it's pretty
straightforward what changes are needed for the persistent state sync as
observed in the struct `StateSync`:

- `state`: redirect directly to the DB layer instead of being
accumulated in the memory.
- `metadata`: handle the state sync metadata on disk whenever the state
is forwarded to the DB, resume an ongoing state sync on a restart, etc.

This is part 2 of
https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/5406#issuecomment-2325064863,
properly handling the block gap generated during fast sync.

Although #5406 remains unresolved due to the known issues in #5663, I
decided to open up this PR earlier than later to speed up the overall
progress. I've tested the fast sync locally with this PR, and it appears
to be functioning well. (I was doing a fast sync from a discontinued
archive node locally, thus the issue highlighted in
https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5663#discussion_r1752124039
was bypassed exactly.)

Once the edge cases in #5663 are addressed, we can move forward by
removing the body attribute from the LightState block request and
complete the work on #5406. The changes in this PR are incremental, so
reviewing commit by commit should provide the best clarity.

Additionally, introduce parameters for specifying a customizable
`ref_time` limit and `proof_size` limit, thereby improving flexibility

# Description

Opening another PR because I added a test to check for my fix pushed in
#6486 and realized that for some reason I completely forgot how to code
and did not fix the underlying issue, since out-of-bounds indexing could
still happen even with the check I added. This one should fix that and,
as an added bonus, has a simple test used as an integrity check to make
sure future changes don't accidently revert this fix.

Now `sp-trie` should definitely not panic when faced with bad
`CompactProof`s. Sorry about that 😅

This, like #6486, is related to issue #6485

## Integration

No changes have to be done downstream, and as such the version bump
should be minor.

The PR does that and reworks the tests in mod.rs to use async backing.

This pure refactoring of state sync is preparing for
https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/4. As the rough plan
in
https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/4#issuecomment-2439588876,
there will be two PRs for the state sync refactoring.

This first PR focuses on isolating the function
`process_state_key_values()` as the central point for storing received
state data in memory. This function will later be adapted to forward the
state data directly to the DB layer for persistent sync. A follow-up PR
will handle the encapsulation of `StateSyncMetadata` to support this
persistent storage.

Although there are many commits in this PR, each commit is small and
intentionally incremental to facilitate a smoother review, please review
them commit by commit. Each commit should represent an equivalent
rewrite of the existing logic, with one exception
https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/commit/bb447b2daa01fecf3bf0ca20c451ac6147f3f8c7,
which has a slight deviation from the original but is correct IMHO.

# Description

This PR is a simple fix consisting of adding a check to the process of
decoding nodes of a storage proof to avoid panicking when receiving
badly-constructed proofs, returning an error instead.

This would close #6485

## Integration

No changes have to be done downstream, and as such the version bump
should be minor.

This PR updates the litep2p backend to version 0.8.1 from 0.8.0.
- Check the [litep2p updates forum
post](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/litep2p-network-backend-updates/9973/3)
for performance dashboards.
- Check [litep2p release
notes](https://github.com/paritytech/litep2p/pull/288)

The v0.8.1 release includes key fixes that enhance the stability and
performance of the litep2p library. The focus is on long-running
stability and improvements to polling mechanisms.

### Long Running Stability Improvements

This issue caused long-running nodes to reject all incoming connections,
impacting overall stability.

Addressed a bug in the connection limits functionality that incorrectly
tracked connections due for rejection.

This issue caused an artificial increase in inbound peers, which were
not being properly removed from the connection limit count.

This fix ensures more accurate tracking and management of peer
connections [#286](https://github.com/paritytech/litep2p/pull/286).

### Polling implementation fixes

This release provides multiple fixes to the polling mechanism, improving
how connections and events are processed:
- Resolved an overflow issue in TransportContext’s polling index for
streams, preventing potential crashes
([#283](https://github.com/paritytech/litep2p/pull/283)).
- Fixed a delay in the manager’s poll_next function that prevented
immediate polling of newly added futures
([#287](https://github.com/paritytech/litep2p/pull/287)).
- Corrected an issue where the listener did not return Poll::Ready(None)
when it was closed, ensuring proper signal handling
([#285](https://github.com/paritytech/litep2p/pull/285)).


### Fixed

- manager: Fix connection limits tracking of rejected connections
([#286](https://github.com/paritytech/litep2p/pull/286))
- transport: Fix waking up on filtered events from `poll_next`
([#287](https://github.com/paritytech/litep2p/pull/287))
- transports: Fix missing Poll::Ready(None) event from listener
([#285](https://github.com/paritytech/litep2p/pull/285))
- manager: Avoid overflow on stream implementation for
`TransportContext`
([#283](https://github.com/paritytech/litep2p/pull/283))
- manager: Log when polling returns Ready(None)
([#284](https://github.com/paritytech/litep2p/pull/284))


### Testing Done

Started kusama nodes running side by side with a higher number of
inbound and outbound connections (500).
We previously tested with peers bounded at 50. This testing filtered out
the fixes included in the latest release.

With this high connection testing setup, litep2p outperforms libp2p in
almost every domain, from performance to the warnings / errors
encountered while operating the nodes.

TLDR: this is the version we need to test on kusama validators next

The `debug` level in `sc-basic-authorship` is now less spammy.
Previously it was outputing logs per individual transactions. It was
quite hard to follow the logs (and also generates unneeded traffic in
grafana).

Now `debug` level only show some internal details, without spamming
output with per-transaction logs. They were moved to `trace` level.

I also added the `EndProposingReason` to the summary INFO message. This
allows us to know what was the block limit (which is very useful for
debugging).

Example:
```
🎁 Prepared block for proposing at 64 (1186 ms) hash: 0x4b5386c13c507d0dbab319ac054cc1bcfa08311e184452221ad07f12ecc6091c; parent_hash: 0x157c…ca5e; end: HitBlockWeightLimit; extrinsics_count: 7032;

Closes: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/6585

Removing the `require_weight_at_most` parameter in V5 Transact had only
one problem. Converting a message from V5 to V4 to send to chains that
didn't upgrade yet. The conversion would not know what weight to give to
the Transact, since V4 and below require it.

To fix this, I added back the weight in the form of an `Option&lt;Weight&gt;`
called `fallback_max_weight`. This can be set to `None` if you don't
intend to deal with a chain that hasn't upgraded yet. If you set it to
`Some(_)`, the behaviour is the same. The plan is to totally remove this
in V6 since there will be a good conversion path from V6 to V5.

We were trapping the host context in case a sub call was exhausting the
storage deposit limit set for this sub call. This prevents the caller
from handling this error. In this PR we added a new error code that is
returned when either gas or storage deposit limit is exhausted by the
sub call.

We also remove the longer used `NotCallable` error. No longer used
because this is no longer an error: It will just be a balance transfer.

We also make `set_code_hash` infallible to be consistent with other host
functions which just trap on any error condition.

Reused as before the `properties` variable when defining a development
chain spec for parachain-template-node.

## Integration

## Review Notes

One line change, pretty self explanatory (it got lost within the history
of changes over the parachain-template-node/chain_spec.rs file). To be
honest, not really sure how useful it is, but I had the choice of
removing the `properties` var or reuse it as before, and I went with the
latter.

This change prevents `pools::apply_slash` from being executed when the
pending slash amount of the member is lower than the ED.

The issue came to light with the failing [benchmark
test](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/actions/runs/11879471717/job/33101445269?pr=490#step:11:765)
in Kusama. The problem arises from the inexact conversion between points
and balance. Specifically, when points are converted to balance and then
back to points, rounding can introduce a small discrepancy between the
input and the resulting value. This issue surfaced in Kusama due to its
ED being different from Westend and Polkadot (1 UNIT/300), making the
rounding issue noticeable.

This fix is also significant because applying a slash is feeless and
permissionless. Allowing super small slash amounts to be applied without
a fee is undesirable. With this change, such small slashes will still be
applied but only when member funds are withdrawn.

# Description

This PR adds the required changes to release `polkadot`,
`polkadot-parachain` and `polkadot-omni-node` binaries built on Apple
Sillicon macos.

## Integration

This addresses requests from the community for such binaries: #802, and
they should be part of the Github release page.

## Review Notes

Test on paritytech-stg solely focused on macos binaries:
https://github.com/paritytech-stg/polkadot-sdk/actions/runs/11824692766/job/32946793308,
except the steps related to `pgpkms` (which need AWS credentials,
missing from paritytech-stg). The binary names don't have a `darwin-arm`
identifier, and conflict with the existing x86_64-linux binaries. I
haven't tested building everything on `paritytech-stg` because the
x86_64-linux builds run on `unbutu-latest-m` which isn't enabled on
`pairtytech-stg` (and I haven't asked CI team to enable one), so testing
how to go around naming conflicts should be covered next.

### TODO

- [x] Test the workflow start to end (especially the last bits related
to uploading the binaries on S3 and ensuring the previous binaries and
the new ones coexist harmoniously on S3/action artifacts storage without
naming conflicts) @EgorPopelyaev
- [x] Publish the arm binaries on the Github release page - to clarify
what's needed @iulianbarbu . Current practice is to manually publish the
binaries built via `release-build-rc.yml` workflow, taken from S3. Would
be great to have the binaries there in the first place before working on
automating this, but I would also do it in a follow up PR.

### Follow ups

- [ ] unify the binaries building under
`release-30_publish_release_draft.yml` maybe?
- [ ] automate binary artifacts upload to S3 in
`release-30_publish_release_draft.yml`

The `GossipEngine::poll_next` implementation polls both the
`notification_service` and the `sync_event_stream`.

If both polls produce valid data to be processed
(`Poll::Ready(Some(..))`), then the sync event is ignored when we
receive `NotificationEvent::NotificationStreamOpened` and the role
cannot be deduced.

This PR ensures both events are processed gracefully. While at it, I
have added a warning to the sync engine related to
`notification_service` producing `Poll::Ready(None)`.

This effectively ensures that `SyncEvents` propagate to the network
potentially fixing any state mismatch.

The default trie cache size before was set to `64MiB`, which is quite
low to achieve real speed ups. `1GiB` should be a reasonable number as
the requirements for validators/collators/full nodes are much higher
when it comes to minimum memory requirements. Also the cache will not
use `1GiB` from the start and fills over time. The setting can be
changed by setting `--trie-cache-size BYTE_SIZE`.

This PR is the second part of the pure state sync refactoring,

observed in the struct `StateSync`:

- `state`: redirect directly to the DB layer instead of being
accumulated in the memory.
- `metadata`: handle the state sync metadata on disk whenever the state
is forwarded to the DB, resume an ongoing state sync on a restart, etc.

This is part 2 of
https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/5406#issuecomment-2325064863,
properly handling the block gap generated during fast sync.

Although #5406 remains unresolved due to the known issues in #5663, I
decided to open up this PR earlier than later to speed up the overall
progress. I've tested the fast sync locally with this PR, and it appears
to be functioning well. (I was doing a fast sync from a discontinued
archive node locally, thus the issue highlighted in
https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5663#discussion_r1752124039
was bypassed exactly.)

Once the edge cases in #5663 are addressed, we can move forward by
removing the body attribute from the LightState block request and
complete the work on #5406. The changes in this PR are incremental, so
reviewing commit by commit should provide the best clarity.

Enhance the `delegate_call` function to accept an `address` target
parameter instead of a `code_hash`. This allows direct identification of
the target contract using the provided address.
Additionally, introduce parameters for specifying a customizable
`ref_time` limit and `proof_size` limit, thereby improving flexibility
and control during contract interactions.

# Description

Opening another PR because I added a test to check for my fix pushed in
#6486 and realized that for some reason I completely forgot how to code
and did not fix the underlying issue, since out-of-bounds indexing could
still happen even with the check I added. This one should fix that and,
as an added bonus, has a simple test used as an integrity check to make
sure future changes don't accidently revert this fix.

Now `sp-trie` should definitely not panic when faced with bad
`CompactProof`s. Sorry about that 😅

This, like #6486, is related to issue #6485

## Integration

No changes have to be done downstream, and as such the version bump
should be minor.

I've been subscribed to this for over 2 years. (you can verify the date of the first issue linked to this)
I'm planning to unsubscribe. I won't be recommending this extension to anyone anymore. Initially, we were concerned about the author's well-being. Eventually, someone made contact with him. I'm glad to hear he's doing well. However, we've been waiting for a long time. I don’t care about the license. He hasn't even bothered to show up and say something like, "Thank you for supporting this extension, but I've been busy lately." Personally, I find him quite arrogant. This attitude cannot steer this community in the right direction.
I am still very grateful to him for creating such a fantastic tool.
However, I hope people don't waste their time on this. If you are interested in developing this, I recommend sharing your idea here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/179053. Let's bring the git graph feature to VSCode.</div>
