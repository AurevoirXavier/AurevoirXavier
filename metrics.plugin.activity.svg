Polkadot SDK use the exact same ABI for `.polkavm` binaries.

Purely relying on RV32E/RV64E ABI is not possible, as PolkaVM uses a

own microarchitecture, i.e. not fully binary compatible.

Approval voting canonicalize is off by one that means if we are
finalizing blocks one by one, approval-voting cleans it up every other
block for example:

- With 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 blocks created, the stored range would be
StoredBlockRange(1,7)
- When block 3 is finalized the canonicalize works and StoredBlockRange
is (4,7)
- When block 4 is finalized the canonicalize exists early because of the
`if range.0 &gt; canon_number` break clause, so blocks are not cleaned up.
- When block 5 is finalized the canonicalize works and StoredBlockRange
becomes (6,7) and both block 4 and 5 are cleaned up.

The consequences of this is that sometimes we keep block entries around
after they are finalized, so at restart we consider this blocks and send
them to approval-distribution.

In most cases this is not a problem, but in the case when finality is
lagging on restart approval-distribution will receive 4 as being the
oldest block it needs to work on, and since BlockFinalized is never
resent for block 4 after restart it won't get the opportunity to clean
that up. Therefore it will end running approval-distribution aggression
on block 4, because that is the oldest block it received from
approval-voting for which it did not see a BlockFinalized signal.

Related to https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/1797

# The problem
When fetching collations in collator protocol/validator side we need to
ensure that each parachain has got a fair core time share depending on
its assignments in the claim queue. This means that the number of
collations fetched per parachain should ideally be equal to (but
definitely not bigger than) the number of claims for the particular
parachain in the claim queue.

# Why the current implementation is not good enough
The current implementation doesn't guarantee such fairness. For each
relay parent there is a `waiting_queue` (PerRelayParent -&gt; Collations -&gt;
waiting_queue) which holds any unfetched collations advertised to the
validator. The collations are fetched on first in first out principle
which means that if two parachains share a core and one of the
parachains is more aggressive it might starve the second parachain. How?
At each relay parent up to `max_candidate_depth` candidates are accepted
(enforced in `fn is_seconded_limit_reached`) so if one of the parachains
is quick enough to fill in the queue with its advertisements the
validator will never fetch anything from the rest of the parachains
despite they are scheduled. This doesn't mean that the aggressive
parachain will occupy all the core time (this is guaranteed by the
runtime) but it will deny the rest of the parachains sharing the same
core to have collations backed.

# How to fix it
The solution I am proposing is to limit fetches and advertisements based
on the state of the claim queue. At each relay parent the claim queue
for the core assigned to the validator is fetched. For each parachain a
fetch limit is calculated (equal to the number of entries in the claim
queue). Advertisements are not fetched for a parachain which has
exceeded its claims in the claim queue. This solves the problem with
aggressive parachains advertising too much collations.

The second part is in collation fetching logic. The collator will keep
track on which collations it has fetched so far. When a new collation
needs to be fetched instead of popping the first entry from the
`waiting_queue` the validator examines the claim queue and looks for the
earliest claim which hasn't got a corresponding fetch. This way the
collator will always try to prioritise the most urgent entries.

## How the 'fair share of coretime' for each parachain is determined?
Thanks to async backing we can accept more than one candidate per relay
parent (with some constraints). We also have got the claim queue which
gives us a hint which parachain will be scheduled next on each core. So
thanks to the claim queue we can determine the maximum number of claims
per parachain.

For example the claim queue is [A A A] at relay parent X so we know that
at relay parent X we can accept three candidates for parachain A. There
are two things to consider though:
1. If we accept more than one candidate at relay parent X we are
claiming the slot of a future relay parent. So accepting two candidates
for relay parent X means that we are claiming the slot at rp X+1 or rp
X+2.
2. At the same time the slot at relay parent X could have been claimed
by a previous relay parent(s). This means that we need to accept less
candidates at X or even no candidates.

There are a few cases worth considering:
1. Slot claimed by previous relay parent.
    CQ @ rp X: [A A A]
    Advertisements at X-1 for para A: 2
    Advertisements at X-2 for para A: 2
Outcome - at rp X we can accept only 1 advertisement since our slots
were already claimed.
2. Slot in our claim queue already claimed at future relay parent
    CQ @ rp X: [A A A]
    Advertisements at X+1 for para A: 1
    Advertisements at X+2 for para A: 1
Outcome: at rp X we can accept only 1 advertisement since the slots in
our relay parents were already claimed.

The situation becomes more complicated with multiple leaves (forks).
Imagine we have got a fork at rp X:
```
CQ @ rp X: [A A A]
(rp X) -&gt; (rp X+1) -&gt; rp(X+2)
         \-&gt; (rp X+1')
```
Now when we examine the claim queue at RP X we need to consider both
forks. This means that accepting a candidate at X means that we should
have a slot for it in *BOTH* leaves. If for example there are three
candidates accepted at rp X+1' we can't accept any candidates at rp X
because there will be no slot for it in one of the leaves.

## How the claims are counted
There are two solutions for counting the claims at relay parent X:
1. Keep a state for the claim queue (number of claims and which of them
are claimed) and look it up when accepting a collation. With this
approach we need to keep the state up to date with each new
advertisement and each new leaf update.
2. Calculate the state of the claim queue on the fly at each
advertisement. This way we rebuild the state of the claim queue at each
advertisements.

Solution 1 is hard to implement with forks. There are too many variants
to keep track of (different state for each leaf) and at the same time we
might never need to use them. So I decided to go with option 2 -
building claim queue state on the fly.

To achieve this I've extended `View` from backing_implicit_view to keep
track of the outer leaves. I've also added a method which accepts a
relay parent and return all paths from an outer leaf to it. Let's call
it `paths_to_relay_parent`.

So how the counting works for relay parent X? First we examine the
number of seconded and pending advertisements (more on pending in a
second) from relay parent X to relay parent X-N (inclusive) where N is
the length of the claim queue. Then we use `paths_to_relay_parent` to
obtain all paths from outer leaves to relay parent X. We calculate the
claims at relay parents X+1 to X+N (inclusive) for each leaf and get the
maximum value. This way we guarantee that the candidate at rp X can be
included in each leaf. This is the state of the claim queue which we use
to decide if we can fetch one more advertisement at rp X or not.

## What is a pending advertisement
I mentioned that we count seconded and pending advertisements at relay
parent X. A pending advertisement is:
1. An advertisement which is being fetched right now.
2. An advertisement pending validation at backing subsystem.
3. An advertisement blocked for seconding by backing because we don't
know on of its parent heads.

Any of these is considered a 'pending fetch' and a slot for it is kept.
All of them are already tracked in `State`.

`InitiateTransfer`, the new instruction introduced in XCMv5, allows
preserving the origin after a cross-chain transfer via the usage of the
`AliasOrigin` instruction. The receiving chain needs to be configured to
allow such this instruction to have its intended effect and not just
throw an error.

In this PR, I add the alias rules specified in the [RFC for origin
preservation](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/blob/main/text/0122-alias-origin-on-asset-transfers.md)
to westend chains so we can test these scenarios in the testnet.

The new scenarios include:
- Sending a cross-chain transfer from one system chain to another and
doing a Transact on the same message (1 hop)
- Sending a reserve asset transfer from one chain to another going
through asset hub and doing Transact on the same message (2 hops)

The updated chains are:
- Relay: added `AliasChildLocation`
- Collectives: added `AliasChildLocation` and
`AliasOriginRootUsingFilter&lt;AssetHubLocation, Everything&gt;`
- People: added `AliasChildLocation` and
`AliasOriginRootUsingFilter&lt;AssetHubLocation, Everything&gt;`
- Coretime: added `AliasChildLocation` and
`AliasOriginRootUsingFilter&lt;AssetHubLocation, Everything&gt;`

AssetHub already has `AliasChildLocation` and doesn't need the other
config item.
BridgeHub is not intended to be used by end users so I didn't add any
config item.
Only added `AliasChildOrigin` to the relay since we intend for it to be
used less.

I am planning to use `alloy_core` to implement precompile support in
`pallet_revive`. I noticed that it is already used by snowbridge. In
order to unify the dependencies I did the following:

1. Switch to the `alloy-core` umbrella crate so that we have less
individual dependencies to update.
2. Bump the latest version and fixup the resulting compile errors.</div>

After finality started lagging on kusama around `2025-11-25 15:55:40`
nodes started being overloaded with messages and some restarted with
```
Subsystem approval-distribution-subsystem appears unresponsive when sending a message of type polkadot_node_subsystem_types::messages::ApprovalDistributionMessage. origin=polkadot_service::relay_chain_selection::SelectRelayChainInner&lt;sc_client_db::Backend&lt;sp_runtime::generic::block::Block&lt;sp_runtime::generic::header::Header&lt;u32, sp_runtime::traits::BlakeTwo256&gt;, sp_runtime::OpaqueExtrinsic&gt;&gt;, polkadot_overseer::Handle&gt;
```

I think this happened because our aggression in the current form is way
too spammy and create problems in situation where we already constructed
blocks with a load of candidates to check which what happened around
`#25933682` before and after. However aggression, does help in the
nightmare scenario where the network is segmented and sparsely
connected, so I tend to think we shouldn't completely remove it.

The current configuration is:
```
l1_threshold: Some(16),
l2_threshold: Some(28),
resend_unfinalized_period: Some(8),
```
The way aggression works right now :
1. After L1 is triggered all nodes send all messages they created to all
the other nodes and all messages they would have they already send
according to the topology.
2. Because of resend_unfinalized_period for each block all messages at
step 1) are sent every 8 blocks, so for example let's say we have blocks
1 to 24 unfinalized, then at block 25, all messages for block 1, 9 will
be resent, and consequently at block 26, all messages for block 2, 10
will be resent, this becomes worse as more blocks are created if backing
backpressure did not kick in yet. In total this logic makes that each
node receive 3 * total_number_of messages_per_block
3. L2 aggression is way too spammy, when L2 aggression is enabled all
nodes sends all messages of a block on GridXY, that means that all
messages are received and sent by node at least 2*sqrt(num_validators),
so on kusama would be 66 * NUM_MESSAGES_AT_FIRST_UNFINALIZED_BLOCK, so
even with a reasonable number of messages like 10K, which you can have
if you escalated because of no shows, you end-up sending and receiving
~660k messages at once, I think that's what makes the
approval-distribution to appear unresponsive on some nodes.
4. Duplicate messages are received by the nodes which turn, mark the
node as banned, which may create more no-shows.

## Proposed improvements:
1. Make L2 trigger way later 28 blocks, instead of 64, this should
literally the last resort, until then we should try to let the
approval-voting escalation mechanism to do its things and cover the
no-shows.
2. On L1 aggression don't send messages for blocks too far from the
first_unfinalized there is no point in sending the messages for block
20, if block 1 is still unfinalized.
3. On L1 aggression, send messages then back-off for 3 *
resend_unfinalized_period to give time for everyone to clear up their
queues.
4. If aggression is enabled accept duplicate messages from validators
and don't punish them by reducting their reputation which, which may
create no-shows.

# Description

This PR changes a few things:
* `--dev` flag will not conflict with `--chain` anymore, but if
`--chain` is not given will set `--chain=dev`.
* `--dev-block-time` is optional and it defaults to 3000ms if not set
after setting `--dev`.
* to start OmniNode with manual seal it is enough to pass just `--dev`.
* `--dev-block-time` can still be used to start a node with manual seal,
but it will not set it up as `--dev` does (it will not set a bunch of
flags which are enabled by default when `--dev` is set: e.g. `--tmp`,
`--alice` and `--force-authoring`.

Closes: #6537

## Integration

Relevant for node/runtime developers that use OmniNode lib, including
`polkadot-omni-node` binary, although the recommended way for runtime
development is to use `chopsticks`.

## Review Notes

* Decided to focus only on OmniNode &amp; templates docs in relation to it,
and leave the `parachain-template-node` as is (meaning `--dev` isn't
usable and testing a runtime with the `parachain-template-node` still
needs a relay chain here). I am doing this because I think we want
either way to phase out `parachain-template-node` and adding manual seal
support for it is wasted effort. We might add support though if the
demand is for `parachain-template-node`.
* Decided to not infer the block time based on AURA config yet because
there is still the option of setting a specific block time by using
`--dev-block-time`. Also, would want first to align &amp; merge on runtime
metadata checks we added in Omni Node here:
https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6450 before starting to
infer AURA config slot duration via the same way.

- [x] update the docs to mention `--dev` now.
- [x] mention about chopsticks in the context of runtime development

The way we build the messages we need to send to approval-distribution
can result in a situation where is we have multiple assignments covered
by a coalesced approval, the messages are sent in this order:

ASSIGNMENT1, APPROVAL, ASSIGNMENT2, because we iterate over each
candidate and add to the queue of messages both the assignment and the
approval for that candidate, and when the approval reaches the
approval-distribution subsystem it won't be imported and gossiped
because one of the assignment for it is not known.

So in a network where a lot of nodes are restarting at the same time we
could end up in a situation where a set of the nodes correctly received
the assignments and approvals before the restart and approve their
blocks and don't trigger their assignments. The other set of nodes
should receive the assignments and approvals after the restart, but
because the approvals never get broacasted anymore because of this bug,
the only way they could approve is if other nodes start broadcasting
their assignments.

I think this bug contribute to the reason the network did not recovered
on `25-11-25 15:55:40` after the restarts.

Tested this scenario with a `zombienet` where `nodes` are finalising
blocks because of aggression and all nodes are restarted at once and
confirmed the network lags and doesn't recover before and it does after
the fix

Closes: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/5551

## Description

With [permissionless lanes
PR#4949](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4949), the
congestion mechanism based on sending
`Transact(report_bridge_status(is_congested))` from
`pallet-xcm-bridge-hub` to `pallet-xcm-bridge-hub-router` was replaced
with a congestion mechanism that relied on monitoring XCMP queues.
However, this approach could cause issues, such as suspending the entire
XCMP queue instead of isolating the affected bridge. This PR reverts
back to using `report_bridge_status` as before.

## TODO
- [x] benchmarks

We removed the `require_weight_at_most` field and later changed it to
`fallback_max_weight`.
This was to have a fallback when sending a message to v4 chains, which
happens in the small time window when chains are upgrading.
We originally put no fallback for a message in snowbridge's inbound
queue but we should have one.
This PR adds it.

# Description

Sending XCM messages to other chains requires paying a "transport fee".
This can be paid either:
- from `origin` local account if `jit_withdraw = true`,
- taken from Holding register otherwise.

This currently works for following hops/scenarios:
1. On destination no transport fee needed (only sending costs, not
receiving),
2. Local/originating chain: just set JIT=true and fee will be paid from
signed account,
3. Intermediary hops - only if intermediary is acting as reserve between
two untrusted chains (aka only for `DepositReserveAsset` instruction) -
this was fixed in https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/3142

But now we're seeing more complex asset transfers that are mixing
reserve transfers with teleports depending on the involved chains.

# Example

E.g. transferring DOT between Relay and parachain, but through AH (using
AH instead of the Relay chain as parachain's DOT reserve).

In the `Parachain --1--&gt; AssetHub --2--&gt; Relay` scenario, DOT has to be
reserve-withdrawn in leg `1`, then teleported in leg `2`.
On the intermediary hop (AssetHub), `InitiateTeleport` fails to send
onward message because of missing transport fees. We also can't rely on
`jit_withdraw` because the original origin is lost on the way, and even
if it weren't we can't rely on the user having funded accounts on each
hop along the way.

# Solution/Changes

- Charge the transport fee in the executor from the transferred assets
(if available),
- Only charge from transferred assets if JIT_WITHDRAW was not set,
- Only charge from transferred assets if unless using XCMv5 `PayFees`
where we do not have this problem.

# Testing

Added regression tests in emulated transfers.

After finality started lagging on kusama around 025-11-25 15:55:40
validators started seeing ocassionally this log, when importing votes
covering more than one assignment.
```
Possible bug: Vote import failed
```

That happens because the assumption that assignments from the same
validator would have the same required routing doesn't hold after you
enabled aggression, so you might end up receiving the first assignment
then you modify the routing for it in `enable_aggression` then your
receive the second assignment and the vote covering both assignments, so
the rouing for the first and second assingment wouldn't match and we
would fail to import the vote.

From the logs I've seen, I don't think this is the reason the network
didn't fully recover until the failsafe kicked it, because the votes had
been already imported in approval-voting before this error.

`InitiateTransfer`, the new instruction introduced in XCMv5, allows
preserving the origin after a cross-chain transfer via the usage of the
`AliasOrigin` instruction. The receiving chain needs to be configured to
allow such this instruction to have its intended effect and not just
throw an error.

In this PR, I add the alias rules specified in the [RFC for origin
preservation](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/blob/main/text/0122-alias-origin-on-asset-transfers.md)
to westend chains so we can test these scenarios in the testnet.

The new scenarios include:
- Sending a cross-chain transfer from one system chain to another and
doing a Transact on the same message (1 hop)
- Sending a reserve asset transfer from one chain to another going
through asset hub and doing Transact on the same message (2 hops)

The updated chains are:
- Relay: added `AliasChildLocation`
- Collectives: added `AliasChildLocation` and
`AliasOriginRootUsingFilter&lt;AssetHubLocation, Everything&gt;`
- People: added `AliasChildLocation` and
`AliasOriginRootUsingFilter&lt;AssetHubLocation, Everything&gt;`
- Coretime: added `AliasChildLocation` and
`AliasOriginRootUsingFilter&lt;AssetHubLocation, Everything&gt;`

AssetHub already has `AliasChildLocation` and doesn't need the other
config item.
BridgeHub is not intended to be used by end users so I didn't add any
config item.
Only added `AliasChildOrigin` to the relay since we intend for it to be
used less.

After finality started lagging on kusama around `2025-11-25 15:55:40`
nodes started being overloaded with messages and some restarted with
```
Subsystem approval-distribution-subsystem appears unresponsive when sending a message of type polkadot_node_subsystem_types::messages::ApprovalDistributionMessage. origin=polkadot_service::relay_chain_selection::SelectRelayChainInner&lt;sc_client_db::Backend&lt;sp_runtime::generic::block::Block&lt;sp_runtime::generic::header::Header&lt;u32, sp_runtime::traits::BlakeTwo256&gt;, sp_runtime::OpaqueExtrinsic&gt;&gt;, polkadot_overseer::Handle&gt;
```

I think this happened because our aggression in the current form is way
too spammy and create problems in situation where we already constructed
blocks with a load of candidates to check which what happened around
`#25933682` before and after. However aggression, does help in the
nightmare scenario where the network is segmented and sparsely
connected, so I tend to think we shouldn't completely remove it.

The current configuration is:
```
l1_threshold: Some(16),
l2_threshold: Some(28),
resend_unfinalized_period: Some(8),
```
The way aggression works right now :
1. After L1 is triggered all nodes send all messages they created to all
the other nodes and all messages they would have they already send
according to the topology.
2. Because of resend_unfinalized_period for each block all messages at
step 1) are sent every 8 blocks, so for example let's say we have blocks
1 to 24 unfinalized, then at block 25, all messages for block 1, 9 will
be resent, and consequently at block 26, all messages for block 2, 10
will be resent, this becomes worse as more blocks are created if backing
backpressure did not kick in yet. In total this logic makes that each
node receive 3 * total_number_of messages_per_block
3. L2 aggression is way too spammy, when L2 aggression is enabled all
nodes sends all messages of a block on GridXY, that means that all
messages are received and sent by node at least 2*sqrt(num_validators),
so on kusama would be 66 * NUM_MESSAGES_AT_FIRST_UNFINALIZED_BLOCK, so
even with a reasonable number of messages like 10K, which you can have
if you escalated because of no shows, you end-up sending and receiving
~660k messages at once, I think that's what makes the
approval-distribution to appear unresponsive on some nodes.
4. Duplicate messages are received by the nodes which turn, mark the
node as banned, which may create more no-shows.

## Proposed improvements:
1. Make L2 trigger way later 28 blocks, instead of 64, this should
literally the last resort, until then we should try to let the
approval-voting escalation mechanism to do its things and cover the
no-shows.
2. On L1 aggression don't send messages for blocks too far from the
first_unfinalized there is no point in sending the messages for block
20, if block 1 is still unfinalized.
3. On L1 aggression, send messages then back-off for 3 *
resend_unfinalized_period to give time for everyone to clear up their
queues.
4. If aggression is enabled accept duplicate messages from validators
and don't punish them by reducting their reputation which, which may
create no-shows.

# Description

This PR changes a few things:
* `--dev` flag will not conflict with `--chain` anymore, but if
`--chain` is not given will set `--chain=dev`.
* `--dev-block-time` is optional and it defaults to 3000ms if not set
after setting `--dev`.
* to start OmniNode with manual seal it is enough to pass just `--dev`.
* `--dev-block-time` can still be used to start a node with manual seal,
but it will not set it up as `--dev` does (it will not set a bunch of
flags which are enabled by default when `--dev` is set: e.g. `--tmp`,
`--alice` and `--force-authoring`.

Closes: #6537

## Integration

Relevant for node/runtime developers that use OmniNode lib, including
`polkadot-omni-node` binary, although the recommended way for runtime
development is to use `chopsticks`.

## Review Notes

* Decided to focus only on OmniNode &amp; templates docs in relation to it,
and leave the `parachain-template-node` as is (meaning `--dev` isn't
usable and testing a runtime with the `parachain-template-node` still
needs a relay chain here). I am doing this because I think we want
either way to phase out `parachain-template-node` and adding manual seal
support for it is wasted effort. We might add support though if the
demand is for `parachain-template-node`.
* Decided to not infer the block time based on AURA config yet because
there is still the option of setting a specific block time by using
`--dev-block-time`. Also, would want first to align &amp; merge on runtime
metadata checks we added in Omni Node here:
https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6450 before starting to
infer AURA config slot duration via the same way.

- [x] update the docs to mention `--dev` now.
- [x] mention about chopsticks in the context of runtime development

can result in a situation where is we have multiple assignments covered
by a coalesced approval, the messages are sent in this order:

ASSIGNMENT1, APPROVAL, ASSIGNMENT2, because we iterate over each
candidate and add to the queue of messages both the assignment and the
approval for that candidate, and when the approval reaches the
approval-distribution subsystem it won't be imported and gossiped
because one of the assignment for it is not known.

So in a network where a lot of nodes are restarting at the same time we
could end up in a situation where a set of the nodes correctly received
the assignments and approvals before the restart and approve their
blocks and don't trigger their assignments. The other set of nodes
should receive the assignments and approvals after the restart, but
because the approvals never get broacasted anymore because of this bug,
the only way they could approve is if other nodes start broadcasting
their assignments.

I think this bug contribute to the reason the network did not recovered
on `25-11-25 15:55:40` after the restarts.

Tested this scenario with a `zombienet` where `nodes` are finalising
blocks because of aggression and all nodes are restarted at once and
confirmed the network lags and doesn't recover before and it does after
the fix

Closes: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/5551

## Description

With [permissionless lanes
PR#4949](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4949), the
congestion mechanism based on sending
`Transact(report_bridge_status(is_congested))` from
`pallet-xcm-bridge-hub` to `pallet-xcm-bridge-hub-router` was replaced
with a congestion mechanism that relied on monitoring XCMP queues.
However, this approach could cause issues, such as suspending the entire
XCMP queue instead of isolating the affected bridge. This PR reverts
back to using `report_bridge_status` as before.

## TODO

We removed the `require_weight_at_most` field and later changed it to
`fallback_max_weight`.
This was to have a fallback when sending a message to v4 chains, which
happens in the small time window when chains are upgrading.
We originally put no fallback for a message in snowbridge's inbound
queue but we should have one.
This PR adds it.

# Description

Sending XCM messages to other chains requires paying a "transport fee".
This can be paid either:
- from `origin` local account if `jit_withdraw = true`,
- taken from Holding register otherwise.

This currently works for following hops/scenarios:
1. On destination no transport fee needed (only sending costs, not
receiving),
2. Local/originating chain: just set JIT=true and fee will be paid from
signed account,
3. Intermediary hops - only if intermediary is acting as reserve between
two untrusted chains (aka only for `DepositReserveAsset` instruction) -
this was fixed in https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/3142

But now we're seeing more complex asset transfers that are mixing
reserve transfers with teleports depending on the involved chains.

# Example

E.g. transferring DOT between Relay and parachain, but through AH (using
AH instead of the Relay chain as parachain's DOT reserve).

In the `Parachain --1--&gt; AssetHub --2--&gt; Relay` scenario, DOT has to be
reserve-withdrawn in leg `1`, then teleported in leg `2`.
On the intermediary hop (AssetHub), `InitiateTeleport` fails to send
onward message because of missing transport fees. We also can't rely on
`jit_withdraw` because the original origin is lost on the way, and even
if it weren't we can't rely on the user having funded accounts on each
hop along the way.

# Solution/Changes

- Charge the transport fee in the executor from the transferred assets
(if available),
- Only charge from transferred assets if JIT_WITHDRAW was not set,
- Only charge from transferred assets if unless using XCMv5 `PayFees`
where we do not have this problem.

# Testing

Added regression tests in emulated transfers.

After finality started lagging on kusama around 025-11-25 15:55:40
validators started seeing ocassionally this log, when importing votes
covering more than one assignment.
```
Possible bug: Vote import failed
```

That happens because the assumption that assignments from the same
validator would have the same required routing doesn't hold after you
enabled aggression, so you might end up receiving the first assignment
then you modify the routing for it in `enable_aggression` then your
receive the second assignment and the vote covering both assignments, so
the rouing for the first and second assingment wouldn't match and we
would fail to import the vote.

From the logs I've seen, I don't think this is the reason the network
didn't fully recover until the failsafe kicked it, because the votes had
been already imported in approval-voting before this error.

                                        I think we should proceed with this once "migrate to umbrella" is completed? I'm uncertain about which one is being utilized most often. Additionally, I've noticed many crates are still referencing
                                        <code>use frame::traits::Currency</code>
                                        . Isn't
                                        <code>Currency</code>
                                        a common used trait? Shouldn't it be included in the prelude? There are many aspects that remain quite unclear to me at this moment.

                                        Make sense.
But after some thoughts, I think it's also good to place the
                                        <code>PalletId</code>
                                        here.
I added
                                        <code>PalletId</code>
                                        to frame-support's root 3 years ago https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8477. At that time, there wasn't a really good place for it. I think it's a good time to move it into
                                        <code>frame_support::pallet_prelude</code>
                                        , it is being used frequently.
